# md.freifunk.net Bind9 Image

> Bind9 container image with configuration for md.freifunk.net

## Releases

A change to the zone file triggers the following actions:
* Generating a new serial number.
* Building a Docker image and pushing it to DockerHub.
* Creating a GitHub release.

Please do not change the serial number, as this is done automatically
on changes to the zone file.

**Version tags** follow the serial numbers, e.g. `v2022060801`.
The version will be the tag for the docker image.

## Deploy
